This is a one-stop shop for finding Planned Parenthood clinics in your state. Click on the name of any state, or the area of the state itself, and you will be redirected to the Planned Parenthood website, showing locations of clinics/types of services provided in that state. For Washington D.C., Maryland, and Rhode Island, click on the text of the state, not the picture of the state. (The links are clickable by canvas boundaries, not linked to the actual image. The image is a background.)

Please keep in mind that Hawaii is literally 1x2 pixels. It's there, we promise. 

It should be mentioned that all three of us were complete beginners in coding at the start of this project.
